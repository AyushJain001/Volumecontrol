## What is MediaPipe? 
MediaPipe is an open-source framework for building pipelines to perform computer vision inference over arbitrary sensory data such as video or audio.
Using MediaPipe, such a perception pipeline can be built as a graph of modular components.



## What is MediaPipe used for? 
The MediaPipe framework is mainly used for rapid prototyping of perception pipelines with AI models for inferencing and other reusable components.
It also facilitates the deployment of computer vision applications into demos and applications on different hardware platforms.
